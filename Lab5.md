- Hello I was working on this code for the lab when I encountered this problem. When I was trying to test my code, 
I ran this command in order to test my code in junit but I received this error. I was wondering if there was something 
wrong with my code or if I typed the command right. 
### TA Response
- Hello there, when running tests for junit you have to use two commands. By the looks of it, you only typed one command 
on the terminal. A possibility is that you may not have typed the  command that compiles the code first. I suggest trying 
that first and then using the command you're currently using. Hope this helps you out!
